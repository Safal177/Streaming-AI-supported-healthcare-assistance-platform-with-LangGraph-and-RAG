# Streaming-AI-supported-healthcare-assistance-platform-with-LangGraph-and-RAG

# Title:
Agentic Healthcare customer support system using LangGraph with streaming and RAG-supported LLM Workflows

# Project overview:
Current healthcare support systems are used to solve a range of customers’ questions: from administrative questions to emergency medical queries. First-generation chatbots which are used rule based tasks, can handle with semantic understanding and self-directed decision processes. To overcome these limitations, agentic AI system is considered. It
•	Identifies user goals and emotions.  
•	Incorporates RAG for accurate knowledge responses. 
•	Dispatches user questions automatically with workflow decision graph.
•	Routes to human agents. 
•	Streams emergency medical operations
•	Supports live and non-live LLM processing

# Mission of the project: 
The objective of this project (end-to-end Agentic AI pipelines with LLM) includes 
•	Tags healthcare customer questions. 
•	Interprets user feelings.  
•	Allocates queries based on context using a graph associated agent. 
•	Runs agents in live streaming approach for questions responses. 
•	Creates evidence-based results using RAG.   
•	Sends user questions to either human agent (or medical team).

# Core tools:
•	google.colab (Python) | 
•	Jupyter Widgets | LangChain | LangGraph | OpenAI (gpt-4o, LLM) GPT-4o.    
•	Vector Database (Chroma) | Prompt Engineering | TypedDict. 
•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
•	Real time and planned LLM Tasks. 

# Notable features:
•	Multi-Agent graph framework
•	Automated query sorting  
•	Emotion-sensitive routing
•	RAG
•	Human involved in the loop pipeline
•	Urgent medical response workflow
•	Online and offline performance
•	Fully configured operational framework
